Project Overview

Kasi Connect is a modern, responsive website designed to connect township-based businesses and service providers to the digital world. The platform allows users to explore local talent and services (such as beauty, plumbing, and tutoring), make enquiries, and get in touch through online forms.

The main goal of this project was to design a professional and interactive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while following feedback and best web development practices.


 
 Feedback from Part 1 AND 2 (and how I improved)

After receiving feedback on Part 1, I made the following major changes and improvements:

Proper Folder and File Structure

The root folder is now named kasi_connect (in lowercase, with no spaces) to follow web development standards.

A clean file structure was created with subfolders for css, js, and images to keep everything organized.

All Pages Fully Coded and Linked

Added and completed the following pages:
index.html, about.html, services.html, beauty.html, plumbing.html, tutoring.html, and enquiry.html.

Each page has a working navigation menu and footer for consistency.

Correct HTML Structure and Formatting

Added the required <header>, <main>, and <footer> tags on every page.

Removed unnecessary whitespace and ensured proper indentation.

Used semantic HTML elements to make the structure cleaner and more accessible.

Typography and Styling

Applied consistent typography to distinguish headings, paragraphs, and buttons.

Used the brand colour #00c4cc (from the Kasi Connect logo) to create a cohesive look.

Added background colours, borders, and shadows for a more modern and visually appealing design.

Responsiveness and Layout

Used flexbox and media queries to make the website fully responsive.

The layout now adjusts seamlessly between desktop and mobile views without horizontal scrolling.

The navigation menu changes from a horizontal layout on desktop to a stacked layout on mobile.

Interactive Elements and JavaScript Features

Added tab sections on the homepage using JavaScript to make content dynamic.

Integrated a responsive image gallery with lightbox functionality.

Added hover, focus, and active pseudo-classes for buttons and links.

Built an interactive contact and enquiry form with JavaScript validation to improve user experience.

Images and Media

Ensured all images load correctly by organizing them in an /images/ folder and fixing file paths.

Added alt text for accessibility and SEO purposes.

SEO Improvements

Added meta descriptions, title tags, and structured heading levels (H1–H3).

Used descriptive URLs and internal linking between pages.

Created robots.txt and sitemap.xml to improve search engine crawling.

Optimized image names and alt text for better discoverability.

Page Speed and Security

Reduced image sizes for faster loading times.

Used relative paths and clean code to avoid broken links or missing assets.


Technologie I Used

HTML5 – for structure

CSS3 – for styling and layout

JavaScript (Vanilla) – for interactivity and form validation
